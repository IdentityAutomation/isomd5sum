NOTE: This `history` branch is an inactive branch.

This branch's sole purpose is to capture all of the history of the project from
when it it was still part of the Anaconda codebase. Future work should still be
done on the master branch. Thanks to @squimrel for putting this together.

iso given nothing more than the iso itself.
