area to store md5sum data about the iso.  This allows you to check the
iso given nothing more than the iso itself.

isomd5sum is hosted on GitHub. The source can be
grabbed via git with
  git clone https://github.com/rhinstaller/isomd5sum.git
or browsed via
  https://github.com/rhinstaller/isomd5sum

Releases of isomd5sum are automatically generated by the tags. eg. for the
1.0.12 release::
